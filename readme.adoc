For doing automated testing of an API I have used a simple BASH script `runner.sh` that runs a CURL command for a number of requests against a list of beneficiaries.

The output from this `runner.sh` has *PHI* which needs to be de-identified and we are interested only extracting the errors.
An `Error` is identified when a Curl request returns a response with the `ErrorID` string in it.
We don't care about the type of error at this point.

== App Intro

This Runner Out to CSV will be written in Node.

The runner output look like this, which is the input to this utility.

<1> Each new beneficiary starts with a `*--` followed by  the 10 digit beneficiary PHI number
<2> Each new Curl request starts with a `**` followed by the name of request
<3> The line after <2> is the time the request was started
<4> An example of a line with a `ErrorID` in it.

In the example above we want the following in a CSV format only when the Request has `ErrorID` in the response

. Run ID, question asked at start of program, String
. Server, another question with a pull down `SOM`, `UHC`
. Environment, another question will a pull down `QA`, `PROD`
. Runner type, another question `Concurrent` or `Solo`, new entries in future 
. Request name, in the example `summary`, drop the API
. Beneficiary ID, de-identified 3rd, 6th and 8th digits so `1112234456` is returned as `{134}`

An example of what the output from this utility is shown below.

NOTE: The output file will always be named ROUT.CSV

== PHI Information

The Runner.out files used by this utility have PHI in them.
This utility needs to be capable of running from any directory, including the encrypted directories where the API test data is kept.

== Node and JavaScript

Currently the Node version is 8.x.x but, the final version needs to work in 10.x.x

When ever possible the newer ES6, also known as ES2015 JavaScript syntax will be used.

== User Interface

I have been very happy when developing CLI NODE app's in using the following libraries

* Chalk - Terminal string styling done right
* clear - Clear the terminal screen if possible
* figlet - Creates ASCII Art from text. A full implementation of the FIGfont spec.
* inquirer - A collection of common interactive command line user interfaces.

These will all be installed with NPM and the `--save` option to put dependicies in the package.json file.

 npm install --save chalk clear figlet inquirer

== Reading files

IN past experiments I have read files into a sting in the app and read through the string.
The OUT files here can be quite large as the number of request and test set expands.

The alternative is a module `line-reader`, Asynchronous, buffered, line-by-line file/stream reader with support for user-defined line separators.

  npm install --save line-reader

The eachLine function reads each line of the given file. Upon each new line, the given callback function is called with two parameters: 
the line read and a boolean value specifying whether the line read was the last line of the file. 
If the callback returns false, reading will stop and the file will be closed.

== Logic

. Look for '*-- beneficiary number', save it
. Look for '** request API', save it
. Read next line save date
. Look for `ErrorID`
. If found write a CSV row out

<<<<

== Application build

If you want to modify this utility with Node then use Git to clone the repository into a new directory

  git clone https://github.com/GeekMustHave/rout2csv.git

Then have NPM rebuild all the dependant libraries.

  npm install

Edit the `index.js` file as required.

Run the utility with `Node`

  node index.js

== Compiling ROUT2CSV

The Node.JS index.js can be compiled into an windows/linux/Mac OS executable by using `pkg'

`pkg` This command line interface enables you to package your Node.js project into an executable that can be run even on devices without Node.js installed.

`pkg` can be installed with the following command

  npm install -g pkg

To prepare the compile to use the `assets` required there is one `figlet` item that needs tro be added to the `package.jsom` file.

Add after the `MAIN` definition

.Additional package.json
----
  "bin": "./index.js",
    "pkg": {
      "assets": "./node_modules/figlet/fonts/Standard.flf"
    },
----

Now to compile the utility perform

  pkg package.json

This will generate an executable for Window, Mab and Linux

* rout2csv-linux - Linux edition
* rout2csv-macos - Mac OS
* rout2csv-win.exe - Windows Edition edition

== Demo

The following is a demonstration of the ROUT2CSV.

== Full Cycle process

The CSV output from this utility is imported into MSAccess to produce reports.

Here is a full-cycle diagram of the entire testing and reporting process.

=== Access Import

The MS Access application for this process is named

The CSV file generate by this utility will be imported to a MS Access application to generate the various reports.

.Import Text File
image::access-import-01.png[Import Text File, align='center']
 
. New data source
. From file
. Text File

.Select CSV file
image::access-import-02.png[Select CSV file, align='center']
 
. Append data to `RunnerResults` table
. Browse and locate CSV files
. Select the correct CSV file to import
. Click kbd:[OK] to proceed

.Delimited file
image::access-import-05.png[Delimited file, align='center']
 
. Just click on kbd:[Next >]

.Configure Import
image::access-import-06.png[Configure Import, align='center']
 
This step is *Very Important*.
It adjusts the `Run-Date` so it doesn't span 2 columns.

. Change text qualifier to quotes `"`
. Check `First row contains field names` is checked on
. Click on kbd:[Next >]

.Finalize import
image::access-import-07.png[Finalize import, align='center']
 
. Make sure table is `RunnerResults`
. Click on kbd:[Finish]

=== Access Reports

==== Run-ID report

This report shows all issues by run-date with run information.

==== Run-Date Report

This report shows each Run-ID with detail issue breakdown for Beneficiary-ID and Request.
